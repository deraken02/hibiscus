Provides two classes

- Reader : for reading bytes from a file
- Writer : for writing bytes in a file

>>> writer = Writer('foo')
>>> writer.write_bytes([100, 90, 32, 10])
4
>>> writer.close()
>>> reader = Reader('foo')
>>> reader.get_bytes(3)
[100, 90, 32]
>>> reader.get_bytes(3)
[10]
>>> reader.get_bytes(3)
[]
>>> reader.reset()
>>> reader.get_bytes(4)
[100, 90, 32, 10]
>>> reader.close()
>>> f = open('foo', 'rb')
>>> reader = Reader(stream = f)
>>> reader.get_bytes(4)
[100, 90, 32, 10]
>>> reader.close()
>>> f = open('foo')
>>> reader = Reader(stream=f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
